# CynanBot

Welcome to the repository for [CynanBot](https://www.twitch.tv/cynanbot), the Twitch trivia game bot.

If you'd like to add CynanBot to your Twitch stream, please talk to me on Discord (`smCharles#1100`) or Twitch ([`smcharles`](https://www.twitch.tv/smcharles)).

CynanBot is rapidly growing, and its codebase is split between two repositories. This repository seeks to encapsulate all of the Twitch/bot related code, whereas [CynanBotCommon](https://github.com/charlesmadere/CynanBotCommon) is where all of the business logic is.
